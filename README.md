## File system
* There is a limition of 55 seconds of each thread's waiting time. Because the sychronization has a ciculation of 60s, any file that haven't been succussfully transferred in 60s will never be done.
* Our system reduces the performance to achieve a higher succussful rate, so please wait patiently before it totally finishes.
